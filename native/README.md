# DOMINION desktop engine evaluation

The chosen product target is an installed PC game, with Steam as a future goal.
This separate Godot prototype evaluates native rendering and navigation before
committing to a full migration. It is not the complete game or a release build.

## Launch on this computer

Double-click `Start-Desktop.cmd`. It copies existing repository assets, imports
them, and launches the portable Godot runtime from `.local-tools/godot`.
No web server is required. The engine and generated asset copies are ignored by Git.

On another computer, download Godot 4.7.2 from
https://godotengine.org/download/windows/, run `prepare-desktop.ps1`, then open
`godot/project.godot` in the editor and press F5.
Godot is MIT licensed: https://godotengine.org/license/.

## World scene (main scene)

`world.tscn` loads `godot/data/map-seed1.json`, a map exported from the browser game
(`index.html?seed=1&export=http://localhost:PORT/name`, see `js/map-export.js`), so both
engines show the same island: 2.5 m height grid, 863 trees, buildings and units.
It uses the Forward+ renderer:

- Terrain shader: grass, dirt, sand and rock (CC0, ambientCG) blended by height,
  slope and noise, two texture scales, triplanar rock, wet band at the waterline.
- Sea shader: Gerstner swell, depth-based colour (seabed visible in shallows),
  refraction, sky reflection through Fresnel specular, shore foam.
- Procedural sky, ACES tone mapping, SSAO, shadows, light fog and glow.
- Birch trees as MultiMeshes in 96 m cells, swaying with per-tree wind; grass tufts
  (real blade triangles) drawn near the camera; drifting cloud shadows.
- Buildings on concrete plinths sunk into the slope.
- Soldiers: matte field uniforms per nation, a single rifle (the source model holds
  all 14 weapons), terrain following, run speed matched to the clip.
- Tanks: weathered army paint with road dust low on the hull (vehicle.gdshader),
  a traversing turret, track animation only while driving, dust trails, and
  pitch and roll with the ground.
- Quality: integrated GPUs start on `balanced` (no SSAO, two shadow cascades, FSR
  at 77%); dedicated GPUs on `high`. Override with `-- --quality=high|balanced|low`.

Controls: click/drag select, right-click move, WASD pan, Q/E rotate, R/F tilt, wheel zoom.
Diagnostics: `--script res://tools/inspect.gd -- <model>` prints a model's nodes, materials and
clips; `-- --capture-views` writes `build/view-*.png`; `-- --feature-probe --no-vsync`
prints the frame cost of each expensive feature.

The earlier three-district prototype is still available: pass `res://main.tscn`.

Not yet ported: combat, economy, logistics, AI, aircraft and ships, pathfinding
around obstacles, saving and Steam integration. Units are still the stylised
Quaternius models; realistic units need new art.

## Validation

Run the Godot executable with:

```text
--headless --path native/godot res://main.tscn -- --smoke-test
--path native/godot res://main.tscn -- --capture-preview
```

Benchmark matching the browser's `?bench=N` (same three camera phases, orbit
formula, marching army and JSON fields):

```text
--path native/godot --resolution 1920x1080 -- --bench=64 --no-vsync --quit-after-bench
```

This runs in the world scene, on the same seeded map and drill as the browser.
The result prints as `DOMINION benchmark {...}` and is saved to
`godot/build/world-bench-<renderer>-<units>.json`, with GPU time and render CPU
time per frame from the engine. Add `res://main.tscn` before `--` to benchmark the
old three-district scene instead.

The smoke test requires 24 models, a route around a district, and actual unit
movement. The graphical command saves `godot/build/preview.png` and exits.
The preview was rendered on Intel Iris Xe; this does not establish full-game
performance. Interactive input still needs user playtesting.

Assets are copied from the repository's Kenney city/suburban, Quaternius character,
and terrain folders. Preserve their original credits and notices; complete the
per-asset license audit before distribution. No new third-party art was acquired.

Next gate: one polished district and a small combat encounter, validated at
1080p with repeatable 24/48/96-unit measurements before deciding on full migration.
